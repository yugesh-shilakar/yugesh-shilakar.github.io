<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a software engineer who can make new and cool websites. I can use HTML and CSS, which are languages that make websites look nice and fit on different screens. I can also make websites do things on the server, using C#, JavaScript, and the .NET Framework. These are tools that help me make websites fast and reliable. I can make websites work well on the browser, using ReactJS. This is a tool that helps me make websites easy to use. 

I can also use other languages and tools for websites, like PHP and Python. They help me write code that runs on the server. I can use MySQL and MongoDB, which are tools that help me store and use data for the websites. I use Git, which is a tool that helps me work with other people on the same website. I use Figma, which is a tool that helps me plan how the websites will look like. I use Trello, which is a tool that helps me keep track of what I need to do. I use Azure, which is a tool that helps me put my websites on the internet. I like to make websites that are useful and fun for people.
