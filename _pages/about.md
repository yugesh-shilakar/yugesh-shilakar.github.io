<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm a dynamic software engineer with over 1 year of hands-on experience in developing cutting-edge web applications. Proficient in [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) and [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), I specialize in crafting visually appealing and responsive user interfaces. My expertise extends to back-end development, where I've honed my skills in [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/), [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript), and the [.NET_Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/)to build robust and efficient server-side functionalities. I am well-versed in client-side development, particularly with [ReactJS](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html), ensuring seamless user experiences.

Additionally, I bring a strong foundation in server-side scripting with [PHP](https://www.php.net/docs.php) and [Python](https://www.python.org/doc/), coupled with database management using [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/). My commitment to version control is evident through my adept use of [Git](https://git-scm.com/doc), facilitating collaborative and efficient project development. With an eye for design, I leverage tools like [Figma](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us) for UI/UX prototyping, while project management tools like [Trello](https://trello.com/guide) keep my workflows organized. Experienced in cloud technologies, I have worked with [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/), further enhancing my ability to deliver scalable solutions. Overall, I am dedicated to creating innovative and user-centric applications that address real-world challenges.

[Project Third Vision](https://github.com/initialrise/AsianHack2022)

This project is an object detection system implemented using Flask and OpenCV. It utilizes computer vision techniques to identify and localize objects within an image or video stream. The system is designed to be deployed as a web application, allowing users to upload images or provide a video feed for real-time object detection.

The project was developed by a team called "Brogrammers" for the Asian Hack 2022 hackathon, where it secured the third position. The team members worked collaboratively to create a robust and efficient object detection solution within the given time frame.
